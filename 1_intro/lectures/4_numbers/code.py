# Two main types of number: whole numbers and floating point numbers
# Also called integers and floats

age = 35  # integer
PI = 3.14159  # float

# Maths works just as normal:

maths_operation = 1 + 3 * 4 / 2 - 2
print(maths_operation)

# Division always results in a float

float_division = 12 / 3
print(float_division)

# But you can drop everything after the decimal, doing
# "integer division"

integer_division = 12 // 3  # drops anything after the decimal (no rounding!)
print(integer_division)
