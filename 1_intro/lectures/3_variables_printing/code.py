# Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. However, they cannot start with a number.
# There are some reserved names because Python uses them for other things.
# For example, don't call your variable print, because print is something else!

# Longer variable names are written in snake_case in Python:

friend_age = 23
countries_visited = 90

# Variable names you will never change are written in all uppercase
