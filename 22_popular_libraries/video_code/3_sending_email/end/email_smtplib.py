If you get an SMTPAuthenticationError even when your password is correct,
it's possible that you have 2-factor authentication enabled.
You'll need to use an App Password to log in instead of your normal password.

If you don't have 2-FA enabled, you'll have to allow access by
less secure apps in your Gmail security preferencesâ€”though remember to deactivate
it once you've finished learning about sending e-mails with Python!
